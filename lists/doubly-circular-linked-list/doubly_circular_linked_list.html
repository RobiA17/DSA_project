        Advantages: List can be traversed from both directions i.e. from head to tail or from tail to head. Jumping from head to tail or from tail to head is done in constant time O(1). Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for the implementation of advanced
        data structures like Fibonacci Heap. Disadvantages It takes slightly extra memory in each node to accommodate the previous pointer. Lots of pointers involved while implementing or doing operations on a list. So, pointers should be handled carefully
        otherwise data of the list may get lost. Applications of Circular doubly linked list Managing songs playlist in media player applications. Managing shopping cart in online shopping.

        <p>Basic linked list operations:</p>

            <li class="linked-second-animation">Insert a new head <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-play"></i></li>
            <li class="linked-third-animation">Remove the last node <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-play"></i></li>
            <li class="linked-fourth-animation">Remove the head <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-play"></i></li>
